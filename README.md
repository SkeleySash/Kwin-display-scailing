# Kwin-display-scailing
A simple way to change kwin display scailing under wayland

These scricpts are kinda hacky in a way. I use them with the shortcuts option in KDE System settings to set up custom keybindings. This is really useful for people with a disability who need a way to change scaling on the fly without having to repon the settings app all the time.

Now updated for 75% and 50% scailing because I upgraded my PC.
